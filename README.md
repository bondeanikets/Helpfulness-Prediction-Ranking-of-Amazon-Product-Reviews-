# Helpfulness-Prediction-Ranking-of-Amazon-Product-Reviews-

This project aims to predict how helpful a review on amazon is by using the previously available data. Most of the reviews shown on Amazon are very outdated because they have been rated by the users while the newer reviews are not popular because they are not rated by many users. Later, reviews are ranked by measuring the information content in them by the Entropy concept.
